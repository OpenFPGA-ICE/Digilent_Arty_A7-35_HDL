# Digilent Arty A7-35

This repository contains small projects for the Digilent Arty A7 development
board. The HDL source files target the Xilinx XC7A35TICSG324-1L FPGA. The
projects exist in three different versions. There are the Verilog and VHDL
versions. These are same projects but use different HDL for the source files.
These projects can be downloaded and loaded in Vivado by means of the .xpr
files found in the corresponding directories.

Then, there is the Migen source files which are written in Python v3. These
can only be compiled if a Migen/LiteX environment has been set up.
