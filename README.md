# Digilent Arty A7-35

This repository contains small projects for the Digilent Arty A7 development
board. The source files target the Xilinx XC7A35TICSG324-1L FPGA. The
projects exist in three different versions: Verilog, VHDL and Migen. Verilog
and VHDL sources are written in Hardware Description Language while the Migen
sources are written in Python v3. The latter are compiled using the Migen/LiteX
environment.

For more information on Migen and LiteX, check out:
* [Migen Manual](https://m-labs.hk/migen/manual/)
* [LiteX GitHub homepage](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex)

Further descriptions of the individual projects are given in the README's
inside every directory.
