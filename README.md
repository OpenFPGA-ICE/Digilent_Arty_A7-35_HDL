# Digilent Arty A7-35

This repository contains small projects for the Digilent Arty A7 development
board. The source files target the Xilinx XC7A35TICSG324-1L FPGA. The
projects exist in three different versions: Verilog, VHDL and Migen. Verilog
and VHDL sources are written in Hardware Description Language while the Migen
sources are written in Python v3. The latter are compiled using the Migen/LiteX
environment.

More information on the individual projects and Migen are given in the
README's inside every directory.
