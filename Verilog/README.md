# Verilog Projects

Projects using source files written in Verilog hardware description
language. Each directory is a different project. A project can be loaded
by opening the .xpr file in each directory with the Xilinx Vivado SDK.

The directories contain the whole project with the compiled files as well.
We were working with the Vivado WebKit version 2018.1.
The bitstream file can be loaded directly on the FPGA. The bitstream
is generally the main.bit file at
Project directory > Project.runs > impl_1 > main.bit
